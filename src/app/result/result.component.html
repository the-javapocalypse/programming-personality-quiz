                You like to be known as a "Jack of all Trades" and a reference for others on your team. You jump at
                every chance to enhance your skills in a wide variety technology topics, not just the ones that apply to
                your day to day work. You don't always know when it might be useful to have these extra skills, but when
                the time comes, you are ready. If more developers took the time to learn other skills outside of the
                ones relevant to their project, they'd work more seamlessly with the rest of their organization because
                they'd have more empathy and understanding of the challenges that their colleagues face.

              <h5>
                If you're a Jack of all Trades, you're a master of none. Mastery in one or two areas is what makes you
                valuable. What's the point of learning skills for other jobs you don't have and can't control? When you
                plan for a project or do technical research, it's always focused on something you're working on. You
                don't get side-tracked. If you learn a new skill, it's because the project requires that you do it. Most
                or all of your hobby projects are also building your mastery of the skills you use at your job.

                You prefer to spend most of your time working in an isolated environment. You rarely want to work with a
                team
                because you have a better chance of solving problems on your own. If you do have to collaborate on the
                direction of a project, you dislike it when you have to defend your position or when others try to muddy
                your plans for the project. It's better to have one strong vision for a project from the lead programmer
                on that project. Having a large team or allowing others to have significant control over the project
                risks communication errors, a muddied code base, and inefficiencies. If one developer has a firm grasp
                on the entire codebase, they'll be much better at fixing and improving it quickly.

                Good code doesn't happen in a vacuum. You need a team to keep you energized and on your toes so that
                you're constantly improving the project code using the entire team's varied experience and strengths.
                You like to talk frequently with colleagues and discuss ideas so that you can learn from others and
                spark ideas. It doesn't matter what their experience level is, you can always learn something by
                including everyone. A solo coder can't possibly code a large software project with the speed and quality
                that a team can.

                Speed is your best weapon in a competitive industry, and to quickly prototype and build new products,
                you need to have a flexible, pragmatic process. You don't have a few months to plan your projects, you
                need to just start coding and a good path for the project will reveal itself. Great products are made
                through frequent feedback and releases, so why shouldn't your plan be just as adaptable? Your plan
                should be adapted to changes in the software, and your expertise should be adapted to the project. You
                shouldn't spend your precious time studying a problem that you're not certain to run into while coding
                your projects. Trying to build test coverage for every possible scenario and having long meetings
                throughout the process are a waste of time and distract you from doing more productive work.

                You believe in the power of well-defined processes. It's crucial to an organization's success that they
                create and follow appropriate and effective processes for building software. Trying to improvise or play
                it by ear invites the possibility of workflow errors that can decrease the quality of the software or
                even cause major product failures. Planning is also extremely important to you. You like to research all
                of the things you will need to know before starting a project. It's important to find out the best
                architecture for your software beforehand, and then strictly implement that architecture with objective
                best practices. The more planning and scaffolding you do in the beginning, the less overall work you
                will have to do to complete the software.
